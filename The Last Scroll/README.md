# ðŸŒ‘ THE LAST SCROLL
*An Interactive Digital Obituary*

---

## The Experience

The internet is dying. You're scrolling through the last fragments of digital history - nostalgic tweets, forum posts, memes that defined generations. But with every scroll, everything decays. Text corrupts. Images glitch. Memories dissolve into static.

**You can save some. But not all.**

## What Happens
1. Scroll through 50+ memories of internet history
2. Watch as everything slowly corrupts in real-time  
3. Save what you can with limited preservation slots
4. Experience the digital apocalypse as memories die
5. View your final vault of preserved history

## Features
- **Progressive Corruption**: Visual decay that accelerates over time
- **Limited Saves**: Only 15 saves force impossible choices
- **Ghost Users**: Other digital souls trying to preserve memories
- **10-Minute Timer**: Countdown to total digital death
- **Scroll Resistance**: Gets harder as the internet dies
- **Memory Vault**: Archive of what you chose to save

## Running Locally
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

## The Philosophy
This isn't just a web experience. It's a meditation on digital impermanence, the weight of choice, and what we preserve when everything is dying.

**Every glitch is intentional. The discomfort is the point.**
